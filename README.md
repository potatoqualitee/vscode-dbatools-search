# search from code for vs code

Search right from your code: dbatools, microsoft docs, google, vs code workspace (find in files) and more.

## Features

By default, this extension allows you to search dbatools.io, microsoft docs, google or your VS Code workspace (find in files) for the highlighted text. The results are displayed in the default browser.

The gif doesn't show it, but this extension can figure out the word selection based on cursor position, so you don't have to explicitly select your text.

## Configuration

Other search providers including Stackoverflow, Technet forums, Solarwinds Thwack and DuckDuckGo are also available but disabled by default. To enable, update your settings. Here's how to do it with the GUI.

File -> Preferences -> Settings -> type `dbatools`
